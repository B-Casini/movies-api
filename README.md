Movies API â€” FastAPI
Just a small API I made with FastAPI to manage a list of movies.

What it does:
Shows all movies

Filters movies by category

Lets you add, update, and delete movies

How to run it:
Clone this repository

Make a virtual environment and activate it

Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt

Run with uvicorn main:app --reload

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs to play with the API
