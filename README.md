Movies API â€” FastAPI

Just a small API I made with FastAPI to manage a list of movies.

What it does:
-Shows all movies

-Filters movies by category

-Lets you add, update, and delete movies

How to run it:
1) Clone this repository

2) Make a virtual environment and activate it

3) Install dependencies with pip install -r requirements.txt

4) Run with uvicorn main:app --reload

5) Open http://127.0.0.1:5000/docs to play with the API
